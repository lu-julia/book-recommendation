# Book Recommender System

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data).

## Recommendation system approaches

Recommendation systems help users discover items, such as movies, books, music, or products, based on their preferences. They are two main approaches to building recommendation systems : 

* **Content-based filtering** recommends books based on their attributes, such as genres, authors, or descriptions. It matches the content of books the user liked in the past to find similar ones.

* **Collaborative filtering** recommends books based on the ratings that users have given to books. It assumes that if two users have rated similar books highly, they will likely enjoy other books rated highly by the other. Matrix factorization techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the user-item rating matrix.
